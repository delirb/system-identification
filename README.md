system identification methods on real EMG Signals 
we wanted to obtain the stiffness of the forearm through supination and pronation movements. so we have to pass it from two different experiments. Firstly, in static trials, the hand was in passive mode, and the other gathered EMG and angular position data in a more dynamic experiment. we are inspired by (19.	E. J. Perreault, R. F. Kirsch, and P. E. Crago, “Multijoint dynamics and postural stability of the human arm,” no. September 2004, doi: 10.1007/s00221-004-1864-7.)
All analyses are done in the frequency domain
