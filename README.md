system identification methods on real EMG Signals 
we wanted to obtain the stiffness of the forearm through supination and pronation movements. so we have to pass it from two different experiments. Firstly, in static trials, the hand was in passive mode, and the other gathered EMG and angular position data in a more dynamic experiment. we are inspired by (19.	E. J. Perreault, R. F. Kirsch, and P. E. Crago, “Multijoint dynamics and postural stability of the human arm,” no. September 2004, doi: 10.1007/s00221-004-1864-7.)

All analyses are done in the frequency domain 

//I am currently finalizing the codes and incorporating additional comments to enhance code clarity. Thank you for your patience. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I will provide additional files as soon as my paper is published.

the first experiment: this contains various steps: 1. how to import data in MatLab 2. how to implement Butterworth filtering 3. Normalizing data between 0-1 4. how to specify exact values of recorded data
5. least square method with lsqminnorm 6. Other math methods are explained in the mentioned paper completely
